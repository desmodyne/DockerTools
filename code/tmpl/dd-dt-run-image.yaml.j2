# NOTE: the script this configuration file (template) belongs to defines the
# configuration properties it expects in this script; as a convention, all
# listed configuration properties must be passed; mandatory ones must have a
# value, optional ones may be null - but  the absence of a property is an error
#
# mandatory conf props are denoted as e.g. {{ local_namespace }};
# optional conf props are denoted as e.g.
#   {{ cont_name if cont_name is defined and cont_name else 'null' }};
# see also 'load script configuration' section of every *Tools script

# docker container image tag naming pattern: <stage>-<hash|semver>

#   release and master branches  : semantic version / repo tag, e.g. 0.5.0
# both commit and semver will have a -DIRTY suffix if building from unclean
